    <h1>
        <center>*<u>American activists</u>*</center>
    </h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph about activists. <b>Martin Luther King(MLK)</b> aimed at <i>integration</i> while <b>Malcolm
            X</b>
        wanted <i>separation</i>
        but later in life he travelled and changed his beliefs about separation</p>
    <p>
        Another paragraph though a closing one, :-).
        In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Frederick Douglass and John Brown aimed at the same though John was radical in
        his
        implementation.

        More about Malcolm X
    </h3>
    <p>
        In 1963 there were deep tensions between Malcolm and Elijah Muhammad over the political direction of the Nation.
        Malcolm urged that the Nation become more active in the widespread civil rights protests instead of just being a
        critic on the sidelines. Muhammad's violations of the moral code of the Nation further worsened his relations
        with Malcolm, who was devastated when he learned that Muhammad had fathered children by six of his personal
        secretaries, two of whom filed paternity suits and made the issue public.

        More about MLK
    </h3>
    <p>
        While in Boston, King met Coretta Scott, a native Alabamian who was studying at the New England Conservatory of
        Music. They were married in 1953 and had four children. King had been pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church
        in Montgomery, Alabama, slightly more than a year when the city’s small group of civil rights advocates decided
        to contest racial segregation on that city’s public bus system following the incident on December 1, 1955, in
        which Rosa Parks, an African American woman, had refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger and as a
        consequence was arrested for violating the city’s segregation law. Activists formed the Montgomery Improvement
        Association to boycott the transit system and chose King as their leader. He had the advantage of being a young,
        well-trained man who was too new in town to have made enemies; he was generally respected, and it was thought
        that his family connections and professional standing would enable him to find another pastorate should the
        boycott fail.

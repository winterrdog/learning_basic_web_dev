        <dt>S/MIME:</dt>
        <dd>
            S/MIME is a standard for secure email messages. S/MIME messages offer sender authentication using digital
            signatures and can be encrypted to protect privacy.
        </dd>

        <dt>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</dt>
        <dd>
            SMTP, short for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is the protocol used for outgoing email on the Internet. It
            defines a message format and a procedure to route messages through the Internet from source to destination
            via
            email servers.
        </dd>

        <dt>Spam:</dt>
        <dd>
            Spam is unsolicited email. Not all unsolicited email is spam, however. Most spam is sent in bulk to a large
            number of email addresses and advertises some product or — considerably less often — political viewpoint.
        </dd>

        <dt>Spammer:</dt>
        <dd>
            A spammer is a person or entity (such as a company) that sends spam emails
        </dd>

        <dt>Spamvertise:</dt>
        <dd>
            Something is spamvertised when it is promoted (or merely appears) in spam. The term is commonly used with
            Web
            sites or email addresses that are part of the body of an unsolicited commercial email.
        </dd>

        <dt>Subject:</dt>
        <dd>
            The "Subject" of an email message should be a short summary of its contents. Email programs usually display
            it
            in a mailbox display together with the sender.

    <h1>Computers</h1>

    <h2>What's a computer?</h2>
    <p class="contentDetailed">A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You
        can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.</p>

    <h2>Analog computers</h2>
    <p class="contentDetailed">Analog computers use continuous physical magnitudes to represent quantitative information. At first they represented quantities with mechanical components (see differential analyzer and integrator), but after World War II voltages were used; by the
        1960s digital computers had largely replaced them. Nonetheless, analog computers, and some hybrid digital-analog systems, continued in use through the 1960s in tasks such as aircraft and spaceflight simulation.</p>

    <h2>Digital computers</h2>
    <p class="contentDetailed">In contrast to analog computers, digital computers represent information in discrete form, generally as sequences of 0s and 1s (binary digits, or bits). The modern era of digital computers began in the late 1930s and early 1940s in the United States,
        Britain, and Germany. The first devices used switches operated by electromagnets (relays). Their programs were stored on punched paper tape or cards, and they had limited internal data storage.</p>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p class="contentDetailed">Hardware is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse.

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p class="contentDetailed">Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.
